# Introduction

Hello, I am the creator of KevinBot for linux.
KevinBot is a chatbot built off of HTML and Javascript.
I wanted to create this chatbot to see if it was possible to make one using purely HTML and Javascript.
As time goes on KevinBot will continue to get more advanced, it is not very advanced at the time of writing this.
Please continue to use KevinBot as more updates come out. 
I will come out with a new update every saturday, if possible.
Kevin is NOT an assistant, it is an experiement.

# How to run
