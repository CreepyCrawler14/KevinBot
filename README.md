# Description

KevinBot is a chatbot built off of HTML and Javascript.
This chatbot was created to prove it was possible to make a chatbot using purely HTML and Javascript.
As time goes on KevinBot will continue to get more advanced, it is not very advanced at the time of writing this.
Please continue to use KevinBot as more updates come out.
A new update will come out every saturday, if possible.
Kevin is NOT an assistant, it is an experiement.
